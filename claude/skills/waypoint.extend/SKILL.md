## Before You Begin

1. **Read the manifest** at `waypoint.manifest.yaml` to understand:

2. **Check document status** in the manifest:
   - `specs`: Feature specifications

Load the **Module Architect Agent** from `.claude/agents/modarch.md`.

Extend WayPoint with new modules:

2. Create module definition with required fields
3. Add few-shot code examples
4. Document conventions and anti-patterns
5. Validate integration with existing modules.
